# Sharp
Python library aiming to create an easy backtesting environment, inspired by Tradingview's pinescript.
Sharp however introduces improvements in managing the history trading simulations and free extended instrument history.
The history data is provided by your API key from TwelveData.
Although the free TwelveData API plan has limited daily and minutely usage, it's plenty for any reasonable amount of historical data. ( Able to extract full data from dozens of instruments per day. )
The data from TwelveData is stored locally.
